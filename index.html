                <p>Reverse Logistics consists of the process of moving goods from their final destination back to the manufacturer for the purpose of recapturing value or proper disposal. It has proven to be an integral part of the Supply Chain Management, and many successful businesses today understand the strategic benefits of having an effective returns process. </p>
                <p>For instance, returned products that are handled efficiently can be reinserted into the supply chain in their current form, or as refurbished or remanufactured products, which can create additional revenue, reduce operating costs, and minimize opportunity costs of writing off defective products. An efficient returns operation can also enhance customers' perceptions of product quality, and boost goodwill of company brand by demonstrating strong competence in all aspects of the Supply Chain Management.</p>
                <p>TDS is proud to serve as a 3rd Party Reverse Logistics Service Provider for the Video Display Industry, providing a wide range of dynamic solutions to our customers to help maximize efficiency within their supply chain cycle.</p>
                <p>TDS recognizes the rapid growth of the electronic display industry, and are committed to serving as a cornerstone in the Reverse Logistics cycle. </p>
